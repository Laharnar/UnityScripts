/*
Hp bar script that uses simple sprite and objects scale

How to create hp bar:
1) Create new sprite via Create/Sprite/Square, or make your own image
2) Assign it as sprite renderer on empty game object
3) Connect it to data with max hp, which is needed for size calculations

Note that object with this  is scaled so script should be on child object.
